# DSTI-ML-PY-STROKES

This repository contains the DSTI ML with Python Labs Project focused on exploring and analyzing stroke data to predict stroke in patients. The project covers the full data science workflow, from data loading and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and reporting of results.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the sample dataset `stroke_data.csv` used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Main exploratory notebook `StrokePredictionEDA.ipynb` which provides a structured overview of the dataset, data processing and cleaning, EDA, feature selection, and results.
- `doc/`: Includes the final report `AnalysisReport.docx` summarizing the analysis and results.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the notebooks and scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/maryamnasir2000/DSTI-ML-PY-STROKES.git
	cd DSTI-ML-PY-STROKES
	```
2. Install the required Python packages:
	```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

## Data

The `data/` folder contains `stroke_data.csv`, a sample dataset with features relevant to stroke prediction. This dataset is used throughout the analysis in the main notebook.

## Main Notebook

The primary analysis is performed in `notebooks/StrokePredictionEDA.ipynb`. This notebook includes:

- **Structured Overview**: Introduction to the dataset and its features.
- **Data Processing & Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for stroke prediction and encoding them.
- **Results**: Presentation of findings and model performance.

## Report

The `doc/AnalysisReport.docx` file contains a detailed report summarizing the analysis, methodology, and results obtained from the project.
